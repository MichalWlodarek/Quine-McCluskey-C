# Quine-McCluskey-C

The minimisation of logic gates is vital when it comes to designing circuits. It simplifies the hardware design and speeds up the circuits. By using different
algorithms to minimise logic gates, designers can produce circuits of higher speed, inexpensive and energy-efficient integrated circuits with increased complexity.
Quine-McCluskey is an algorithm used for simplifying Boolean functions.

The algorithm has been implemented in C language. It uses user-input to minimise user entered Boolean expressions. It will also display the process of the algorithm 
step by step for the user to see.
